Maybe I got unlucky with a defective mattress, but where's quality assurance for this company? That flat out should not happen. Emphasis on flat. Cause that's what the mattress was. Seriously horrible experience, ruined my friend's stay with me. Then they make you ship it back instead of just providing a refund, which is also super annoying to pack up an air mattress and take it to the UPS store.

Take medication as prescribed: Thyroid patients typically need to take synthetic thyroid hormones to regulate their hormone levels. It's important to take the medication exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider to ensure proper thyroid function.\\n\\n2. Get regular check-ups: Thyroid patients should have regular check-ups with their healthcare provider to monitor thyroid hormone levels and adjust medication dosage if necessary.\\n\\n3. Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support thyroid function. Some thyroid patients may also benefit from avoiding certain foods that can interfere with thyroid hormone production, such as soy and cruciferous vegetables.\\n\\n4. Manage stress: Stress can affect thyroid function, so it's important for thyroid patients to find ways to manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, and other stress-reducing activities.\\n\\n5. Stay active: Regular exercise can help support overall health and metabolism, which can be beneficial for thyroid patients. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new exercise routine.\\n\\n6. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol: Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can have negative effects on thyroid function, so it's best to avoid these habits or limit them as much as possible.\\n\\nThese are just some general precautions that thyroid patients can take, but it's important for each individual to work with their healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan for managing their thyroid condition.\""
